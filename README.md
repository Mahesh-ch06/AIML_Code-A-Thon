# CODE-A-THON: 21-Day Machine Learning Challenge


## Project Description

This project is a hands-on, structured 21-day challenge designed to help participants develop a solid foundation in machine learning. Each day introduces new concepts, with initial days covering essential Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The challenge progresses to fundamental algorithms, including Linear and Logistic Regression, with guided learning through tutorials and practical coding exercises.
